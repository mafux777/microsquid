# microsquid

This subsquid aims to solve the problem that the official kintsugi subsquid does not have token transfers or xtoken transfers.

It's not perfect, but it's a start. It lets you analyse:

* token transfers on kintsugi itself 
* xToken transfers, from kintsugi to karura or moonriver

It does not yet offer:

* xToken transfers to kintsugi
* KSM transfers to and from the relay chain (Kusama)
